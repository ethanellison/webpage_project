Tag is an element
Contents in header do not appear on the page
div elements are full width (nextLine), block element
in line fits to size (span), does not take up the full block
div soup = only using div elements in entire webpage, fixed by html5

never scroll right on on html document
th are cells in a table
in body, td is data (cell data)
inline styles are no good better to use css
img tag inserts photos styles can be controlled through css

forms:
method, and action : GET displays info in the url and POST does it behind the 
scences. Would use GET to pass parameters within the URL and POST to hide sensitive
items like address or passwords.
ACTION is the file the form is linked to

<input> class references a CSS class, placeholder = temporary text before user 
inputs texts
type = type of inputs (ex checkbox, button)

radio buttons: input type = "radio" : same name allows them to not be checked at the
same time. Delivery and pickup options

<select> : contains options whose value is the option you specify. kinda like a 
dropdown menu

<button> just like wpf

embedding video: flash is dying. 
<video> controls property doesnt need a value. <source src="source"

doctypes work best in the header: metatages do not need to close, thats what appears
under webpage google search
